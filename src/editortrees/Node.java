	// You will probably want to add more constructors and many other
	// recursive methods here. I added 47 of them - most were tiny helper methods
	// to make the rest of the code easy to understand. My longest method was
	// delete(): 20 lines of code other than } lines. Other than delete() and one of
	// its helpers, the others were less than 10 lines long. Well-named helper
	// methods are more effective than comments in writing clean code.
	
	// TODO: By the end of milestone 1, consider if you want to use the graphical debugger. See
	// the unit test throwing an error and the README.txt file.
